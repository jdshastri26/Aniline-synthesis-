Explanation

    Load the deSolve library: This library is used for solving differential equations.
    Define initial concentrations: Starting concentrations for nitrobenzene and aniline.
    Define rate constants: Rate constant for the reaction.
    Rate equations: Differential equations describing the reaction kinetics.
    Parameters: A list containing the rate constants.
    Time sequence: Time points at which to solve the differential equations.
    Solve ODEs: Using ode function from deSolve to solve the equations.
    Plot the results: Using ggplot2 to visualize the concentrations of reactants and products over time.
